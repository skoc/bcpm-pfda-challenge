Phase 2 model summary
This document is meant to be a summary of the models used on the Phase 2 data. Provide the following details for EACH sub-challenge within “Summary-Phase2.txt”

------------------------------
Summary-Phase2-Sub-challenge-1
------------------------------
Provide information on model settings and parameters used:

The model fitted on Phase 1 data is applied to Phase 2 data to make predictions. No special settings or paramaters are used in Phase 2 prediction.

Specifically, the stacked tree model built from Phase 1 described in Summary-Phase1.txt for subchallenge 1 is applied to the same 12 selected gene expression features and 4 clinical phenotype features of the Phase 2 data.

Summary-Phase2-Sub-challenge-2
------------------------------
Provide information on model settings and parameters used:

The model fitted on the Phase 1 data is applied to Phase 2 data to make predictions. No special settings or paramaters are used in Phase 2 prediction.

Specifically, the lightgbm model built from Phase 1 described in Summary-Phase1.txt for subchallenge 2 is applied to the same 7 selected CNV features and 4 clinical phenotype features of the Phase 2 data.

------------------------------
Summary-Phase2-Sub-challenge-3
------------------------------
Provide information on model settings and parameters used:

The model fitted on the Phase 1 data is applied to Phase 2 data to make predictions. No special settings or paramaters are used in Phase 2 prediction.

Specifically, the lightgbm model built from Phase 1 described in Summary-Phase1.txt for subchallenge 3 is applied to the same 6 selected features and 4 clinical phenotype features of the Phase 2 data.
